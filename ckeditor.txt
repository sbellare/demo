Hi SACHIN,

Thank you for yesterday's call. It was great learning about your clients use case. I have checked and as suspected SEC.gov is one of our clients who already uses CKEditor in one of their projects called TRENDS. 
Attached is a copy of the proposal for the new project that 3di would be working on. In the proposal I have provided you prices for CKEditor, comments and track changes plugins. 

Also, you have mentioned that you had an issue with the CKE demo for react. Please review the links below and if you still have issues then please send our team a technical request explaining your issue and we'll do our best to help you out since I already have talked with the team. You can email us directly at support@cksource.com.

Example of CKEditor 5 with track changes and comments in React app https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-collaboration-samples/tree/master/track-changes-for-react


Please review the proposal and let me know if the client would like to move forward with the proposed license. 

I look forward to hearing from you.
